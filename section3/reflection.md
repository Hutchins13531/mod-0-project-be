## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

* The Pomodoro technique provides a steady workflow while offering an opportunity to briefly disconnect, this has made the weekly workflow seem productive while not overwhelming.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

* Both are like a "list" or collection of memory cells that can store something (a number, a string, etc.) Arrays typically have a definitive size as to where a Hash is basically infinite.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

* pet_store = {lizards: 20, birds: 30, hamsters: 60, cats: 10}

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

* states["IA"]

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

* states.keys
  states.values

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

* When listing inventory, hash would be better because you can list an endless number of elements.


8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

* None at this time.
