# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  def print_name(name)
  end
        def print_two(first, last)
            puts "My name is #{first} #{last}."
          end


          print_two("Brad", "Hutchins")end

print_name("Harry Potter")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
def num_sum(x, y)
  puts (x + y)
  return x + y
end

num_sum(4,9)

# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in.

def car_make(a, b)
  puts "My favorite car_make is #{a}, because #{b} is too expensive."
end

car_make("Audi","Maserati")

# PART 3: Naming is Hard
#-------------------


# Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable
# or function concisely enough that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive
# enough that others can infer the meaning.

# Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the
# function, and why?
# car_make.downcase: It is descriptive of both variables

# What did you name each parameter, and why?
# a/b.downcase: keepts items simple in relation to one another
