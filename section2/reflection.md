## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

*One thing that continues to resonate with me is the thought process of becoming better than we were
yesterday. I believe instructors along with my colleagues can all agree, that's ultimately what led us to Turing, either to grow, or aid with the growth of others.... or both as we're all one team with one purpose.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

*I feel that I demonstrate a Growth Mindset by continuing to push myself outside of my usual comfort zone and embrace my vulnerabilities with positive reinforcements. However, sometimes I spend more time trying to find solutions on my own when simply asking for help will result in faster resolution.  

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

*Conditional statements are algorithms navigated by a series of parameters such as "if, elseif, and else".

Example 1.
beach = 'relax'
if beach == 'stormy'
  p "no beach"
elsif beach == 'sunny'
  p "lets tan"
elsif beach == 'windy'
  p "fly kite"
elsif beach == 'crowded'
  p "social distance"
else
  p "have fun!"
end

Example 2.
outside_temp = 65
if outside_temp > 55
  puts "Don't build a fire"
elsif outside_temp < 55
  puts "Okay to build a fire"
end

Example 3.
number_of_players = 4
has_ball = true

if number_of_players < 4
  puts "cannot play"
elsif number_of_players > 3
  puts "lets play"
elsif has_ball == true
  puts "lets play"
elsif has_ball == false
  puts "cannot play"
end

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

*If-statements are to account for multiple scenarios and circumstances or multiple outcomes.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if (condition)

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

*Curly Brackets

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

*if conditional [then]
   code...
[elsif conditional [then]
   code...]...
[else
   code...]
end
