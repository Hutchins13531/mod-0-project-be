# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
quote = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p quote

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
  new_students = 2
p students + new_students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
  transfer_students = 2
p students - transfer_students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "John"
is_hungry = "true"
number_of_pets = 4

# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# I assigned a name to the "first_name" variable, assigned a boolean response of
#true to the "is_hungry" variable, lastly, assigned an integer to the "number_of_pets"
#variable.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "John"
  first_name["John"]= "Alice"
is_hungry = "true"
  is_hungry["true"]= "False"
number_of_pets = 4
  number_of_pets[4]= 9


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
total_snacks = 14;
p total_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?

#Yes
