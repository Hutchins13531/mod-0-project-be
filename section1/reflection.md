## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

- Asking questions is very beneficial and builds trust and community amongst peers. I'm my own worse enemy when it comes to asking for help... I'll beat a dead horse as I'll problem solve on my own. This is one of my greatest challenges.
