1. What were your reflections from the video?

- My take away from the video is that everyone has their own strengths and that
anything outside of inclusivity is limiting.

2. In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?

- Having a degree of self-awareness, and understanding that it's okay to challenge
society and the way a culture accepts diversity vs how I choose to accept diversity.

3. What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding
biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?

- I currently work for the non-profit Remote Area Medical, whose mission is to "prevent
pain and alleviate suffering by providing free, quality healthcare to those in need", as
this organization is a safety net for the underserved, I would love to help develop a new
program to aid with tracking services, volunteer/patient data, donor activities, and more.
Just to have a custom platform that captures their wide variety of needs will aid with
ensuring the continued care for individuals, families, and communities around the world.
It's crucial to avoid biases when challenging yourself to serve others to truly create a
selfless environment and to trust that everyone matters and that everyone is deserving
of a better future.  

4. When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are
you most aware of on a daily basis?

- My strengths often reside hidden behind my insecurities, as a Filipino raised in East TN,
the fact that I'm not a white male will never escape me as people and close friends often
remind me of it, embracing my differences takes the power away from others to use it against
me negatively. Being over weight bares the same mental awareness. Resiliency is a condition
of growth the exact opposite of erosion, with any negative awareness I might have of myself,
it creates strengths that others can't help but to acknowledge.

5. How do you think you could value the identities of those around you to bring out their
strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people
around you?

- I believe it's important to build everyones confidence, not only as professionals but as
individuals. Not saying that everyone will always and forever agree on everything but it's
important to know that's okay too. When did it become the expectation for everyone to agree
all the time, when is that acceptable in any sphere of reality? The truth is, our uniqueness
as individuals are what makes us valuable to others. If everyone were the same life would be
boring. Everyday we have the opportunity to impact the lives of someone else.

6. How will your strengths impact you as a teammate? What will you bring to your cohort?

- I feel that a positive attitude is my best feature at the moment, as software development
is completely new to me, I feel that my only value as a good teammate at this point is to be
positive and supportive to the rest of my team.
